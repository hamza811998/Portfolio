## Projects
### [Traffic Sign Classification Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/hamza811998/P-03-Traffic_Sign_Classification_Using_Deep_Learning)
Traffic sign classification is an important task for self-driving cars. In this project, the dataset contains 43 different classes of images. The project understands the theory and intuition behind Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Imports key Python libraries, datasets, and performs image visualization. Performs image normalization and converts images from color-scaled to gray-scaled. Builds a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a back-end. Compiles and fit Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to training data. Assess the performance of the trained Convolutional Neural Network model and ensure its generalization using various KPIs.
