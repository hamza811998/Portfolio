# Portfolio
This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Science and Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. This portfolio also contains my Achievements, skills, and certificates. It is updated regularly.

## About me
Student at [COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore](https://lahore.comsats.edu.pk/default.aspx), doing M.S./M.Phil., Mathematics. I've done research in the field of *Mathematical Modeling / Mathematical Biology* under the supervision of [Dr. Sadia Arshad](https://lahore.comsats.edu.pk/Employees/807). My research topic was ***Dynamical Analysis of the Epidemic Models of COVID-19 and Influenza***. I am interested in all things data and machine learning systems.

## Projects
### [Traffic Sign Classification Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/hamza811998/P-03-Traffic_Sign_Classification_Using_Deep_Learning)
Traffic sign classification is an important task for self-driving cars. In this project, the dataset contains 43 different classes of images. The project understands the theory and intuition behind Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Imports key Python libraries, and datasets, and performs image visualization. Performs image normalization and converts images from color-scaled to gray-scaled. Builds a Convolutional Neural Network using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a back-end. Compiles and fits Deep Convolutional Neural Network model to training data. Assess the performance of the trained Convolutional Neural Network model and ensure its generalization using various KPIs.
